# Create a New Project
At this point, you should have Visual Studio installed and open.

You will want to create a new Project to get started.  A Project is a collection of code that results in either an executable (exe), or a reusable library (dll).

You will want to make an executable project for this 101 tutorial.
- `File -> New -> Project`
- Find and select **`Console App (.NET Core)`**.
  Note there are alternative options such as .NET Framework; Do not select those.
- Modify the location to be to your preference

_Side note:  A Solution will be made alongside your initial project.  A Solution is just a workspace where multiple projects can exist, which may or may not use and be related to each other.  This then lets you build all projects at once if you have multiple._
