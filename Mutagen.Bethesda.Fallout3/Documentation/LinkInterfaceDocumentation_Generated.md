# Link Interfaces
Link Interfaces are used by FormLinks to point to several record types at once.  For example, a Container record might be able to contain Armors, Weapons, Ingredients, etc.

An interface would be defined such as 'IItem', which all Armor, Weapon, Ingredients would all implement.

A `FormLink<IItem>` could then point to all those record types by pointing to the interface instead.
