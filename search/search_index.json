One of its main features is offering interfaces and classes for the records that exist at compile time and are first class citizens in C#. With actual members for each field they get the benefits of type safety, simple live debugging, Intellisense features such as autocomplete. The interfaces offer clean API to the user and abstract away much of the binary record specifics and oddities of how they are stored on disk, while the actual implementation remains very closely tied to the data offering as much speed as it can by leveraging some of the latest C# features. Most of the public facing API is created by code generation, with small manual snippets of code for the one-off special cases.

If the source Npc had a null Destructible, the the target will get a null Destructible.</p> <p>In summary: <code>onOverall = false</code> is what we'd set if we did not want it to have any effects, and wanted <code>Destructible</code> to not be considered whatsoever. <code>onOverall = true</code> (default), is what we'd set if we wanted the mask to be applied, in which case <code>defaultOn</code> and any field settings would take effect during the application.</p>"},{"location":"plugins/Translation-Masks/#best-practices","title":"Best Practices","text":""},{"location":"plugins/Translation-Masks/#create-once-use-many","title":"Create Once, Use Many","text":"<p>Usually you do not need to create a translation mask per call.

Often one route to deal with this is to define generics: <pre><code>public void MyFunction&lt;TMod, TModGetter&gt;(TMod mod)\n    where TModGetter : IModGetter\n    where TMod : IMod, TModGetter, IMajorRecordContextEnumerable&lt;TMod, TModGetter&gt;\n{\n    // Do something\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>This is often a great route to allow the caller to know what type they want to interact with, and let them decide. However, at some point higher up in your code, adding generics becomes burdensome, or the API cannot offer generics for one reason or the other.</p> <p>What happens when we have a call that is not generic, but wants to call one that is? <pre><code>public class MyClass\n{\n    public void DoSomeThings(IMod mod)\n    {\n        // What do we put here?\n        DoSomeThingsGeneric&lt;???, ???&gt;(mod);\n    }\n\n    private void DoSomeThingsGeneric&lt;TMod, TModGetter&gt;(TMod mod)\n        where TModGetter : IModGetter\n        where TMod : IMod, TModGetter, IMajorRecordContextEnumerable&lt;TMod, TModGetter&gt;\n    {\n        // Actual logic\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>The answer is that we would use C# reflection to make the first function call the 2nd.
